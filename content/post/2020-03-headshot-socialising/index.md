So I think I have accidentally created a clickbait title for this blog post - so if you are here looking for some kind of weird shooting related social content prepare to be horrifically disappointed...😁

Last Tuesday we arranged for some members of our group to meet up to start taking headshots of them to upload on our website - being launched soon so keep those eyes peeled! As like most things we try to do the semi-formal image taking session devolved into loose madness. There were debates over yellow or white backgrounds, so we ended up taking one photo of each person with one yellow background and one white. I mean I love the enthusiasm for the yellow but it was a little pointless because as the website creator no yellow is going anywhere near my beautiful creation. (Yeah, that's right, I am vetoing the colour yellow, what you gonna do about it)
Whilst the great yellow debates were happening some beautiful pictures were being taken of our team members. I am going to post some of the most beautiful on our Facebook and Instagram page so go and check them both out! [Click Me](https://www.instagram.com/yorkaerospace)

After we managed to get thousands of stunning images a group of us headed to the hottest spot in town for cheap drinks and chips - the Charles. Had a lovely relaxed chat whilst we got to know each other. Crazy schemes have now been planned - apparently, the team mascot is going to be a bee now... I'm sure if they all arrive in America dressed as bees, we will be taken as the serious no-nonsense team of scientists that we are💪

We [ well realistically I] have also decided that we would all benefit from some lovely drinking social events next term, so keep an eye on the Facebook page for details on that when I plan it - which I will.

This will probably be the last blog post for this term - because let's be real, I have a life that I want to live that doesn't involve buying bee costumes on amazon - so thanks for a really positive term guys and I am excited to see what the next one brings!
