York Aerospace and Rocketry (YAR) is a student rocketry/aerospace engineering society hailing from the University of York. We gather students from all disciplines and studies to collaborate on designing, building and flying model rockets and other aerial vehicles. Our founding goals are to push towards milestones like competitions, motor classes and altitudes in our homebrew designs, and to test our own skills and ingenuity by exploring novel solutions to obstacles that we run into.

As a society, we’ve found that reliable information about amateur rocketry and aerospace often tends to be difficult to locate, conflicting, subjective and outdated, so we’ve made it a core part of our ethos to avoid perpetuating this. Thus, we aim to help everyone who joins in our activities walk away with all the domain knowledge or skills that they can, trying to:

- Focus on working with newer members in sessions
- Encourage active participation in all our events
- Encourage members to bring their own projects and ideas to sessions and seek help with them within the society
- Keep everything we do documented in obvious places and announce everything of note to our public mailing list
- Make all our software and designs open-source

# Current Projects

Let's move on to looking at some of our current projects. On the aerostructure side, Nordri is our main launch vehicle platform and is the culmination of all our past experiences. For this project we've focused on designing for simplicity of manufacture, using cheap & easy to acquire materials, and making sure we have room to make changes and continue to iterate as we make more flights. The low-cost and accessible manufacturing techniques make this a great rocket for inexperienced members to get started with, requiring only standard workshop tools and normal craft glues for basic assembly. However, we also have room to grow with this same design, using epoxy fillets, a fibreglass fin layup, and trying different materials for some parts, such as a delrin thrust ring. You can be sure to look forward to a full blog post on Nordri soon!

The other side of YAR is geared more towards electronics, with the main focus at the moment is creating an avionics package we can fly in any of our rockets. Initially, we just wanted to be able to collect data on our flights such as altitude and acceleration, to see if these lined up with our simulations. But over time the project requirements grew quickly - now that we're getting towards bigger rockets and higher altitudes, GPS and radio modules are required to help us find the rocket after it's landed. Hand in hand with this is a dual-deploy recovery system, which the avionics package must trigger when the time is right. Again, you can look forward to an in-depth blog post about our progress on avionics in the near future.
# Future goals

In the coming months, we will be launching our local club events to demonstrate and test both avionics and rockets. This, along with our design and manufacturing workshops, should give our members enough experience to attempt their Level-1 certification, allowing them to fly larger and more powerful motors.

We're very excited to be part of the Mach-22 competition this year held at Machrihanish Airbase in Scotland, where we'll be launching Nordri to a height of 1km. This launch will also house our avionics package, demonstrating its capabilities as a dual deploy system, and working from data we will have gathered from the avionics on prior test flights. Looking further ahead, we hope to attend EUROC, a European University Rocketry competition, either this year or in the near future.

That's all from us for now, but check back soon for a more detailed look at some of our projects, our design process and our manufacturing techniques!
